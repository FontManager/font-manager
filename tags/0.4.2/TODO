 * Allow users to export collections

    - Export collection to .pdf

    - Export collection to an archive [iso]
    

 * Optimize the way fonts are "blacklisted"
 
    - Right now they are all blacklisted at once and in the same file.
    
    * This isn't really an issue for the application, as on my system
      de-activating 6000+ fonts only takes it a few seconds.
      
      But depending on open programs, blacklisting that many fonts at
      once in the same file can have a noticeable impact on the desktop.

      Â¿ when the file is parsed ?
      
      So a whole new approach is probably a good idea.
