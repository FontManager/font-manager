Font Manager

A font management application for the GNOME desktop

Font Manager is an application that allows users to easily manage fonts on their system.

Font Manager is not intended to be a professional-grade font management solution,
but rather a simple application suitable for the needs of most desktop users.

Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind,
it should work well with most major desktop environments such as XFCE, Enlightenment,
and even KDE.


Font Manager currently allows the user to:

    * Preview installed fonts

    * Compare fonts

    * Install and remove fonts

    * Easily activate and de-activate installed fonts

    * Specify different directories to search for fonts

    * Group fonts into "Collections", and easily activate or de-activate groups of fonts

    * Export "Collections" to an archive for easy backup, sharing, etc.

    * Provides quick access to all GNOME font utilities.


In the future Font Manager intends to allow the user to:

    * Export "Collections" to a PDF "fontbook" (partially implemented)

    * Edit font metadata

    * Convert fonts to a different format
