These extensions are intended to provide integration with Nautilus, Nemo and Thunar file managers.

They are a work in progress.

Currently they allow easy previewing of font files by simply selecting them while font-viewer is open and add an install item to the context menu.

The Thunar extension also adds very basic bulk renamer support.
