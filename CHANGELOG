Major changes between 0.7.3 to 0.7.4

- Drop dependency on gucharmap library.

    Gucharmap is no longer in active development, and while the developers
    were receptive to changes, our changes are so invasive that they wouldn't
    make much sense upstream.

- Drop dependency on Gee library

- Determine whether file-roller is available at runtime.

    --with-file-roller flag dropped.

- Closes Issue #12

    Added font substitution preference pane.

- Closes Issue #40

    Added "Copy Location" and "Show in Folder" entries to the font list context menu.

- Partially addresses Issue #48

    Added "Copy to.." and "Compress..." entries to the collection list context menu.

- Closes Issue #16

    Character map now only displays those codepoints which are present in selected font.
