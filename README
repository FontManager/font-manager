       A simple font management application for GTK+ Desktop Environments


|============================= Version 0.7.4 ==================================|


Features that are expected to work at this time:

    Migration of fonts and collections from the previous version

    Font Previews

    Enabling / Disabling Fonts

    Creating / Deleting / Enabling / Disabling of Font Collections

    Font Installation
        - By drag and drop (Preferred method)
        - By using the file selector

        Note : Drag and drop should allow installation of not only individual
               font files but also entire directories and archives. The file
               selector unfortunately will not allow selection of directories.

    Font removal

        Note : Font Manager only allows for removal of fonts owned by the user
               and installed in the default user font directory.
               Removal of fonts owned by others is not supported.
               Removal of fonts installed elsewhere is not supported.

    Font directory monitoring

        Note : Font Manager should reload itself anytime fonts are installed
               or removed either through the application or any other method.

    Font Sources

        Adding / Removing font folders.

        Note : Fonts in these folders should be available for preview in the
               application even if they are not enabled system wide.

    Opening Font Files

        The application can be set as the default handler for font files.
        When called with the path to a font file it will launch a font viewer.
        The font viewer is very simple and is only intended for previewing
        and installing individual font files.

    File Manager Extensions

        When the font viewer is running you should be able to preview font files
        by simply selecting them in the file manager.

        To enable an extension pass --enable-pycompile --with-nautilus,
        --with-thunar or --with-nemo to configure.

        For more details and known issues see the README file in the extensions
        directory.


Missing / Planned features :

    Character map details viewer

    Database search

    FontConfig editor
        - per font settings

    Exporting Collections
        - proof sheet
        - html?

KNOWN ISSUES

    Some themes do not render as intended. This is a problem with the theme.
    Unless the issue also occurs when using Adwaita, or most other themes...
