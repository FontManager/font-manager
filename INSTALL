Building & Installing Font Manager
==================================


Building
--------

Font Manager uses the Meson <http://mesonbuild.com> and Ninja
<https://ninja-build.org> build systems. To build Font Manager, 
run the following commands from the top-level directory of the 
source code repository:

    meson setup --prefix=/usr --buildtype=release build
    ninja -C build

See the `meson.build` file in the top-level directory for the complete
list of required dependencies and minimum versions.


Running
-------

If you wish to try Font Manager before installing it, you may 
execute it directly from its build directory:

    build/src/font-manager/font-manager


Installation
------------

After Font Manager has built, install it by invoking the install target:

    ninja -C build install

After installation, it can be uninstalled in the same way:

    ninja -C build uninstall
