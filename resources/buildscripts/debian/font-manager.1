rather a simple application suitable for the needs of most desktop users
and even some graphics designers who may need to manage just a few thousand
font files. Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind,
it works well with most major desktop environments such as XFCE,
Enlightenment, and KDE.

has been written with Python and GTK+2 and after installing the application
you can run it from the

menu.
