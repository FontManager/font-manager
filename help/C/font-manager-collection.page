<p>Collections are completely virtual, you can create however many you like, they can overlap, they can be nested if you like. Their main purpose is to allow you to easily <link xref="font-manager-activating">enable/disable</link> groups of fonts all at once. They can also be used similar to a tag based classification since they are non-exclusive, or be used to organize your fonts by client or project that you need a set of font families for.</p> 

<p>Collections are saved automatically when the application closes.</p>

<p>To add fonts, drag and drop onto the collection. The collections view will reveal itself if you are dragging fonts from the main <link xref="font-manager-fontlist">font list</link> to the left and switch back to <link xref="font-manager-category">category</link> view once you’re done. To reorder collections or nest them, just drag them around or into each other. </p>

<p>Within the collections view, you can add a font family to other collections by dragging from one collection’s font list to another collection in the collection list.</p> 

<p>To remove font families from a collection, press the <gui>-</gui> symbol in the collection’s font list. </p>

<p>Collection data are kept in a JSON file (<code>~/.config/font-manager/Collections.json</code>), Syntax is self-explanatory. Keep your backups if you edit by hand.</p>
