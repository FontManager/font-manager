= Release Notes 0.5.6 =

<p>
As requested by [http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=29 Issue #29],
font-manager will now try to move any changes made  in ~/.fonts.conf to ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf rather than simply overwriting them.
<br /> <br />
If you are upgrading from a version older than 0.5.5, or even if you're not, it's possible that font-manager will get this wrong the first time and end up moving an old default configuration to ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf. If that happens you can just delete it. If you use a customized local.conf and it gets overwritten, you _should_ find the previous version was backed up as local.conf-previous.
<br /> <br />
Sorry for the inconvenience.
<br /> <br />
</p>
<p>
By default font-manager will now ask Pango for a localized sample string and use that instead of the default pangram.<br />
If you dislike this behavior you can disable it in the Interface tab of the preferences dialog.
</p>
<p>
As requested by [http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=34 Issue #34], font-manager now includes a utility to aide in performing clean up of imported folders.
<br />
"Font Janitor" allows for mass renaming and deletion of font files from imported folders. If you're interested in trying it out you'll need to enable it in the preferences dialog. <br />But please keep in mind that this utility has seen very little testing. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
</p>

<p>
This release also adds support for [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationIndicators "Application Indicators"].
</p>

=== General ===

<p>
Font Manager will ask for confirmation anytime it needs to restart, unless it's minimized, in which case it will simply show a notification.
</p>

<p>
Please do not file issues regarding fonts that have naming issues, are broken or those that restrict embedding in their license,
if you need to rename, fix or maybe you just don't care about licenses then a font editor is your friend.
</p>

=== Notes for those installing from source ===

<p>
Check the README for requirements, and make sure they are available, they should 
be on any recent distro. Python deps are checked at runtime.

If updating from source, make sure to completely remove the previous version, 
either by running 'make uninstall' from the source directory or by doing something like

rm -rf /usr/local/share/font-manager

or whatever prefix you specified during the install.
</p>

=== Localization ===
<p>
Not sure how friendly this app is to other locales, but if it works well in yours 
and you are able to provide a translation for it that would be great.

Thanks.
