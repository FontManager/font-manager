= Release Notes 0.4 =

Users who have customized their ~/.fonts.conf, should take a backup before 
running Font Manager. After running Font Manager, you can add your customizations 
to ~/.!FontManager/config/render.conf, just create the file if it doesn't exist. 
This will ensure that they do not get overwritten by the application.

An autoscan option has been added to the preferences dialog, this option is *not* 
well tested or complete, there is no progress reported, aside from directories 
being added to the list, and for now there is no way to cancel the operation aside 
from killing the application.

Autoscan looks in the following directories :
 * /home/`<`yourusername`>`
 * /media
 * /mnt
 * /opt
 
and attempts to find any folders that contain fonts.
 
You probably should *not* use this feature if you have network shares or other 
filesystems to which access may be very slow in those paths. If you wish to test 
it anyways, you can just kill the application if the scan is taking too long, 
changes are not applied automatically so it shouldn't be a problem if this 
process is interrupted.

A 'refresh' feature has been added that will attempt to reload the application 
without re-starting when directories or fonts are added or removed. This may fail 
at times, if so the application just needs to be re-started. 
If this fails consistently for you, please file an issue.


=== Notes for those installing from source ===

Check the README for requirements, and make sure they are available, they should 
be on any recent distro. Configure does not check for deps, 
deps are checked at runtime and then only for the required python modules.

If updating from source, make sure to completely remove the previous version, 
either by running 'make uninstall' from the source directory or by doing something like

rm -rf /usr/local/share/font-manager

or whatever prefix you specified during the install.


=== Localization ===

Not sure how friendly this app is to other locales, but if it works well in yours 
and you are able to provide a translation for it, please grab the package 
tagged i18n from the downloads section on the homepage.

Thanks in advance.


==== Other ====

My apologies to anyone who is working on or has already completed a translation, 
I think I may have jumped the gun on requesting those, a lot has changed 
between 0.3 and 0.4 so those will need to be updated.

At this point, I'm pretty satisfied with the feature set and feel that the 
application is pretty useful as is. The focus now shifts to improving on what's 
already there. So releases will be done at a much slower pace, and the next few 
releases will not see anything in the way of added features, releases will only be 
done for critical bugs or when there are enough bugfixes/translations/enhancements to warrant it.
