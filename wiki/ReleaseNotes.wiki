= Release Notes 0.5.4 =

<p>
Users who have customized their ~/.fonts.conf, should move it before running Font Manager.
<br></br>
After running Font Manager, you can add your customizations to *~/.config/font-manager/local.conf*,
just create the file if it doesn't exist.
<br></br>
This will ensure that they do not get overwritten by the application.
</p>

<p>
Apologies in advance, as you'll have to reset your preferences, a lot of new preferences were added and I didn't want to deal with backwards compatibility...
<p>

<p>
The family search box now contains and "Advanced Search" option which allows filtering the selected collection by family name, type, manufacturer, and filepath.
</p>

<p>
Font files can now be installed by dragging them onto the family column.
<br></br>
If possible, they will also be added to the currently selected collection.
</p>

<p>
Users can now define "actions" to run on the currently selected font, this is accessed by right clicking the selected font. 
<br></br>
This option has not seen much testing, if you run into problems please file an issue.
</p>

<p>
Since the "Sample sheet" feature had to be separated from the application to prevent it from "keeping" the memory used during PDF generation,
<br></br>
Font Manager now also ships with a small utility, font-sampler, which can be called to generate a sample sheet from any directory of fonts. 

This utility only accepts !TrueType and Type 1 fonts, some !OpenType fonts may be compatible but most aren't.
</p>

=== General ===

<p>
The application restarts itself anytime changes require it and may take a moment to start back up depending on the number of additional fonts.
</p>

<p>
I suggest you do not try to create a sample sheet from any collection or folder that exceeds 2500 fonts.
<br></br>
Doing so can not only take a long time but also lots of cpu and loads of memory.

Please do not file issues regarding fonts that have naming issues, are broken or those 
that restrict embedding in their license,
<br></br>
if you need to rename, fix or maybe you just don't care about licenses then a font editor is your friend.
</p>

=== Notes for those installing from source ===

<p>
Check the README for requirements, and make sure they are available, they should 
be on any recent distro. Python deps are checked at runtime.

If updating from source, make sure to completely remove the previous version, 
either by running 'make uninstall' from the source directory or by doing something like

rm -rf /usr/local/share/font-manager

or whatever prefix you specified during the install.
</p>

=== Localization ===
<p>
Not sure how friendly this app is to other locales, but if it works well in yours 
and you are able to provide a translation for it that would be great.

Thanks in advance.
