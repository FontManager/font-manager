- Finish up on font-viewer

- Find a sane way to handle files containing multiple fonts (.ttc)
  For now typically only the first style is displayed.

- Possibly enable system-wide font installation and removal.
  This would require PolicyKit, and using an application specific "Library" in 
  /usr/local/share/fonts, so that's there's no chance that we ever modify anything
  installed through the distributions package manager.

- Enable DBus service? Would anyone even find it useful?
