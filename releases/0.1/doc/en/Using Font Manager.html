<h1><img style="width: 48px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/preferences-desktop-font.png"> Font Manager</h1>
The Font Manager interface is divided into three main areas*<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 858px; height: 530px;" alt="" src="images/font-manager-zones.png"><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please note that while any
changes made are applied immediately, any open applications will need
to be re-started to reflect those changes.</span></small> <br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If Font Manager is open when fonts are installed or removed, it will also need to be re-started.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</small><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 48px; height: 49px;" alt="" src="images/1.png"> <br>
<br>
<p>The Collections area where you can add or remove collections simply
by clicking the add or remove buttons, activate entire collections by
clicking the checkmark, or de-activate them by clicking the X.</p>
<p>After creating a new collection, to place fonts in it just drag and
drop them from the fonts column onto your newly created collection.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><img style="width: 48px; height: 49px;" alt="" src="images/2.png"></p>
<p><br>
The Fonts area where you can select which font to preview, activate or
de-activate fonts and also search through the
list of fonts.</p>
<br>
<img style="width: 48px; height: 49px;" alt="" src="images/3.png"><br>
<br>
<p>This is the Preview area where you can select which style of font to
display by using the combobox at the top, the size of the font used in the preview can be
changed with the slider at the bottom, or for more control you can use
the spinbutton at the top right of the preview area. <br>
You can also
choose to enter your own text to see how it would look in the selected
font.<br>
</p>
<p>Here you can also get information about the currently selected font, such as file location and size. <br>
If gnome-font-viewer is installed on your system it will be used to
show any available descriptions, copyrights, etc. for the
selected font. <br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<address>* Font Manager has been designed to be as simple and intuitive
as possible, hopefully you find this to be true, but if not please let
us know how it may be improved.</address>
