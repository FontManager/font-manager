Font Manager

A font management application for the GNOME desktop

Font Manager is an application that allows users to easily manage fonts on their system.

Font Manager is not intended to be a professional-grade font management solution,
but rather a simple application suitable for the needs of most desktop users,
and even graphics designers who may need to manage just a few thousand font files.

Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind,
it should work well with most major desktop environments such as XFCE, Enlightenment,
and even KDE.


Font Manager currently allows the user to:

    * Preview installed fonts
    
    * Compare fonts
    
    * Install and remove fonts

    * Easily activate and de-activate installed fonts

    * Specify different directories to search for fonts

    * Group fonts into "Collections", and easily activate or de-activate groups of fonts

    * Export "Collections" to an archive for easy backup, sharing, etc.

    * Provides quick access to the users font folder
      so that font installation or removal can be done by drag and drop

    * It can also display basic information about the selected font,
      detailed information if gnome-font-viewer is available


In the future Font Manager intends to allow the user to:

    * Export "Collections" to a PDF "fontbook"


Requirements:

    * Python      2.x  >= 2.5   http://www.python.org/
    * PyGTK       2.xx          http://www.pygtk.org/
    * PyGobject   2.xx          http://www.pygtk.org/

    You can also just try running the program ;-)
    
    python src/FontManager.py
    
    to see if it complains about anything.
