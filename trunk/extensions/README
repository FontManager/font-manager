    ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/

Thunar:

    /usr/share/thunarx-python/extensions/
    ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/

Nemo:

    /usr/share/nemo-python/extensions/
    ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/


If you installed the extension to a system directory, compile the extension

For example:

    python -m compileall /usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
    python -O -m compileall /usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
