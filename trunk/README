ALPHA release! This release is a preview intended for testing purposes only!

Please DO file issues regarding features that are already implemented and not
functioning as intended. However, make sure you are running the latest revision.

Please DO NOT file issues regarding feature enhancements or missing features at
this time.

Features that are expected to work at this time:

    Migration of fonts and collections from the previous version.

    Font Previews

    Enabling / Disabling Fonts

    Creating / Deleting / Enabling / Disabling of Font Collections

    Font Installation
        - By drag and drop (Preferred method)
        - By using the file selector that is shown when the add button is pressed

        Note : Drag and drop should allow installation of not only individual
               font files but also entire directories and archives. The file
               selector unfortunately will not allow selection of directories.

    Font removal

    Font directory monitoring

        Note : Font Manager should reload itself anytime fonts are installed
               or removed either through the application or any other method.

    Font Sources

        Adding / Removing font folders.
        Fonts in these folders should be available for preview in the application
        even if they are not enabled system wide.


Features that need to be completed before release:

    Help contents


Features that will likely be completed before release:

        - per font settings
        - aliases (low priority)

KNOWN ISSUES

    Some themes do not render as intended. This is a problem with the theme.
    Unless the issue also occurs when using Adwaita, or most other themes...
