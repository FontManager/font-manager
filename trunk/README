       A simple font management application for Gtk+ Desktop Environments


|============================= Version 0.7.2 ==================================|


Please DO NOT file issues regarding feature enhancements or missing features at
this time.

However feel free to comment at

    https://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=85


Features that are expected to work at this time:

    Migration of fonts and collections from the previous version

    Font Previews

    Enabling / Disabling Fonts

    Creating / Deleting / Enabling / Disabling of Font Collections

    Font Installation
        - By drag and drop (Preferred method)
        - By using the file selector

        Note : Drag and drop should allow installation of not only individual
               font files but also entire directories and archives. The file
               selector unfortunately will not allow selection of directories.

    Font removal

    Font directory monitoring

        Note : Font Manager should reload itself anytime fonts are installed
               or removed either through the application or any other method.

    Font Sources

        Adding / Removing font folders.

        Note : Fonts in these folders should be available for preview in the
               application even if they are not enabled system wide.

    Nautilus extension

        When the font viewer is running you should be able to preview font files
        by simply selecting them in Nautilus.

        To enable the extension pass --with-nautilus to configure.

        Extensions for Thunar and Nemo are also included, however they have not
        been tested. Use --with-thunar or --with-nemo.
        Feedback on those is appreciated.

Missing / Planned features :

    Help contents

    Character map details viewer

    Database search

    FontConfig editor
        - session-wide settings
        - per font settings
        - aliases (low priority)

    Exporting Collections
        - proof sheet
        - html?


KNOWN ISSUES

    Some themes do not render as intended. This is a problem with the theme.
    Unless the issue also occurs when using Adwaita, or most other themes...
