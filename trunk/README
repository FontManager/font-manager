Font Manager

A simple font management application for Gtk+ Desktop Environments

Font Manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily manage desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools or editing configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with the Gnome Desktop Environment in mind, it should work well with other Gtk+ desktop environments.

Font Manager is NOT intended to be a professional-grade font management solution. 


=== Version 0.7 ===

Initial release of Vala/Gtk+3 version.

Please DO NOT file issues regarding feature enhancements or missing features at

Features that are expected to work at this time:

    Migration of fonts and collections from the previous version.

    Font Previews

    Enabling / Disabling Fonts

    Creating / Deleting / Enabling / Disabling of Font Collections

    Font Installation
        - By drag and drop (Preferred method)
        - By using the file selector that is shown when the add button is pressed

        Note : Drag and drop should allow installation of not only individual
               font files but also entire directories and archives. The file
               selector unfortunately will not allow selection of directories.

    Font removal

    Font directory monitoring

        Note : Font Manager should reload itself anytime fonts are installed
               or removed either through the application or any other method.

    Font Sources

        Adding / Removing font folders.
        Fonts in these folders should be available for preview in the application
        even if they are not enabled system wide.

KNOWN ISSUES
