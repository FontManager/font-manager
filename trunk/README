ALPHA release! This release is a preview intended for testing purposes only!

Please DO file issues regarding features that are already implemented and not
functioning as intended. However, make sure you are running the latest revision.

Please DO NOT file issues regarding feature enhancements or missing features at
this time.


Features that are expected to work at this time:

    Migration of fonts and collections from the previous version.

    Enabling / Disabling Fonts

    Creating / Deleting / Enabling / Disabling of Font Collections

    Font Installation
        - By drag and drop (Preferred method)
        - By using the file selector that is shown when the add button is pressed

        Note : Drag and drop should allow installation of not only individual
               font files but also entire directories and archives. The file
               selector unfortunately will not allow selection of directories.


Features that need to be completed before release:

    Font removal

    Font Metadata viewer

    Character map details viewer

    Database search

    Help contents


Feature parity with previous versions is a high priority but not a blocker.
