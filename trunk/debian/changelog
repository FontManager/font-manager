font-manager (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update (0.3)
	    Added the ability to compare fonts, thanks to gnome-specimen.
	    When detailed info is requested it now brings up the selected style.
	    Changed the way font information is loaded, this allows the application
	    to have a map of exactly which files belong to which font family.
	    It unfortunately also means that loading fonts is significantly slower,
	    to compensate for this, results are now cached and re-used.

	    Startup times on an X2 5600+ :

	    First run  - 6300 fonts = 3m30.738s - Ouch!
	    Second run - same fonts = 0m4.969s

	    Also added a basic splash screen to provide some feedback in case
	    someone actually has that many active fonts on their system.
	    Various bug fixes.
	    Code cleanup.

  * Update (0.2)
        Properly handle font names containing illegal characters.
        Return only the first result when detailed info is requested
        Added option to select different directories to scan
        Added option to export collections to an archive
        Added a category for fonts not present in user collections
        Added preferences dialog 

  * Initial release (0.1)
