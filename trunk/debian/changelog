font-manager (0.4.4-1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Update (0.4.4)

        Maintenance release.

        Fix redraw/corruption issues when widgets are shown/hidden or panes
        are repositioned.

        Fix unnecessary escapes in treeview text column.

        Fix typos affecting the way illegal xml characters are escaped.

        Some code cleanup

        Removed the "font info" button, because gnome-font-viewer sucks and the
        latest "improved" version is even silly enough to allow installation of
        already installed fonts...

        The rename collection button/dialog was also dropped as it's unnecessary,
        renaming collections can be done directly by clicking on the collection
        name once it's been selected.

        The "font info" feature should be back in a future release along with a
        more competent, at least according to me, "font-viewer" and the ability
        to edit font details.

  * Update (0.4.3)

        Added the following options

          Start application at login
          Start application minimized
          Include pangram in sample sheets
          Set default font size for sample sheets

        Removed unnecessary, possibly confusing, confirmation dialog 
        when removing collections.

        Correct permissions for installed files.

        Some code cleanup

        Clean up obsolete files.

  * Update (0.4.2)

        Fix tray icon behavior, clicking it should always have an effect

        Fix homepage link in about dialog

        Don't allow exporting of empty collections, duh

        Include AFM files when exporting Type 1 fonts, oops, must
        not be a lot of use for this function or maybe Type 1 fonts,
        or someone would have mentioned it... oh, well it's useful to me. ;-)

        Ask for confirmation before exporting a collection

        Fix http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=6 by
        allowing user to specify where exported collection is to be saved,
        whether it should be compressed or not, and whether to include
        a sample sheet in the archive or folder.

        This last feature only works if ReportLab is installed and then
        only for Truetype and Type 1 fonts. Open Type supposedly works
        but I don't have any that do.

  * Update (0.4.1)

        Restart app instead of attempting to reload in place.

  * Update (0.4)

        Re-factored user interface to have a more flexible layout and take up
        less space while displaying the same amount of information.

        Added font installation/removal.

        Various bug fixes.

  * Update (0.3)

        Added the ability to compare fonts, thanks to gnome-specimen.

        When detailed info is requested it now brings up the selected style.

        Changed the way font information is loaded, this allows the application
        to have a map of exactly which files belong to which font family.
        It unfortunately also means that loading fonts is significantly slower,
        to compensate for this, results are now cached and re-used.

        Startup times on an X2 5600+ :

        First run  - 6300 fonts = 3m30.738s - Ouch!
        Second run - same fonts = 0m4.969s

        Also added a basic splash screen to provide some feedback in case
        someone actually has that many active fonts on their system.

        Various bug fixes.

        Code cleanup.

  * Update (0.2)

        Properly handle font names containing illegal characters.

        Return only the first result when detailed info is requested

        Added option to select different directories to scan

        Added option to export collections to an archive

        Added a category for fonts not present in user collections

        Added preferences dialog

  * Initial release (0.1)
