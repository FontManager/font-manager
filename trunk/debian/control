Description: A font management application for the GNOME desktop
 Font Manager is not intended to be a professional-grade font management
 solution, but rather a simple application suitable for the needs of most
 desktop users.
 .
 Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind, it should work
 well with most major desktop environments such as Xfce, Enlightenment, 
 and even KDE.
