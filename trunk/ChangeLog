    * Update (0.3)
        Added the ability to compare fonts, thanks to gnome-specimen.
        When detailed info is requested it now brings up the selected style.
        Changed the way font information is loaded, this allows the application
        to have a map of exactly which files belong to which font family.
        It unfortunately also means that loading fonts is significantly slower,
        to compensate for this, results are now cached and re-used.

        Startup times on an X2 5600+ :

        First run  - 6300 fonts = 3m30.738s - Ouch!
        Second run - same fonts = 0m4.969s

        Also added a basic splash screen to provide some feedback in case
        someone actually has that many active fonts on their system.
        Various bug fixes.
        Code cleanup.
