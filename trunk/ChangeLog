  * Update (0.5.7)

        Allow sorting families by right-clicking.
        http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=42

        Address an issue where selecting a collection causes unintended
        drag and drop effect.
        http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=41

        Add font version field to the font information dialog.
        http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=40

        Allow managing collections while in "Browse" mode.
        Enable browse mode by default.

        Allow re-ordering while in compare mode.

        Add family type filter to advanced search dialog.
        This uses Panose values and won't display fonts which don't supply them.

        Use images which are friendlier to dark backgrounds.
        i.e. Ubuntu's default tooltips

        Add Launchpad translators to the credits dialog.
        Add Italian, Russian and Slovak translations. 
        Translations are not enabled by default yet.

        Users wishing/willing to test and provide feedback should do

        ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-nls
        make
        make install


  * Update (0.5.6)

        Address an issue where our window is still displayed at startup even
        though both minimize on startup and minimize to tray are enabled

        Address and issue where failure to load a font file causes startup to
        abort with a useless error message.

        Automatically try to move any customizations found in ~/.fonts.conf to
        ~/.config/font-manager/local.conf instead of simply overwriting them.
        You should still edit local.conf directly and not rely on this.

        Browse mode now displays disabled fonts and uses the same size setting
        as the rest of the application, it also includes a size slider.

        Added a dialog which allows mass renaming and deletion of files in
        imported folders. This has to be enabled in the preferences dialog.
        This feature has seen very little testing so... USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


    * Update (0.5.5)

        Address an issue where fontconfig/pango updates cause previews to stop
        displaying properly for disabled families.

        Address an issue where fonts from user configured folders which are
        not in the users home directory get placed into the System category.

        Address an issue where fonts with family names containing non-ASCII
        characters are unusable. If you experienced this, please reset the
        applications cache to remove outdated entries.

        Added a fontconfig editor which allows users to configure settings for
        individual families and styles.
        * <matrix> transformations are not supported.

        Added an alias editor which allows users to configure font substitution.

        Cut down on the number of events that require a restart.


    * Update (0.5.4)

        Fix several bugs introduced in the 0.5.x releases, hopefully without
        introducing new ones.

        Several interface improvements. The most important one being that
        the application now saves most of it's state when closed,
        i.e. window size, preview font size, compare colors, pane positions, etc.

        Added an option to keep the current collection focused when adding
        families to other collections as suggested at
        http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=18

        Added a "browser mode" as suggested at
        http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=19

        Switch to Mallard-based help, unfortunately this means users who do
        not have Yelp installed will not have access to it. :-(

        Then again, anyone who's reading the help pages for any reason other
        than just being bored should file a bug detailing why they needed help,
        and what would make things easier. ;-)


    * Update (0.5.3)

        Fix several errors due to escaped/unescaped markup.

        Separated the "sample sheet" feature from the rest of the program to
        prevent the application from 'keeping' the memory used during
        pdf generation. Added font-sampler, a stand-alone script that can be
        called by the user to generate a "sample sheet" from a directory of fonts.

        As suggested by http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=8
        Added a way for users to add "actions" that can be called on font files
        directly from the family column by right clicking.

        As suggested by http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=7
        Added an "Advanced Search" dialog that allows filtering the selected
        collection based on family, filetype, foundry or filepath.

        Added drag and drop installation of font files.
        Font files can now be dragged onto the family column and they will be
        installed and if possible added to the selected collection.


    * Update (0.5.2)

        Fixes a lot of issues in 0.5.1


    * Update (0.5.1)

        This is a major update, *almost* a complete rewrite.

        Not much has changed as far as the user interface goes, but under
        the hood almost everything is shiny and should hopefully make it easier
        to maintain and extend Font Manager. :-)

        The applications private directories now follow the XDG specifications,
        which not only helps keep user home directories cleaner but also makes
        it easier when doing backups. Old files should automatically be migrated
        to the new structure.

        Font information is now kept in an SQLite3 database.

        The 'font info' feature is back, it's now provided by the application
        itself and is able to display much more detailed information.

        Also fixed a regression from the last update which caused re-ordering
        collections by drag and drop to fail.


    * Update (0.4.4)

        Maintenance release.

        Fix redraw/corruption issues when widgets are shown/hidden or panes
        are repositioned.

        Fix unnecessary escapes in treeview text column.

        Fix typos affecting the way illegal xml characters are escaped.

        Some code cleanup

        Removed the "font info" button, because gnome-font-viewer sucks and the
        latest "improved" version is even silly enough to allow installation of
        already installed fonts...

        The rename collection button/dialog was also dropped as it's unnecessary,
        renaming collections can be done directly by clicking on the collection
        name once it's been selected.

        The "font info" feature should be back in a future release along with a
        more competent, at least according to me, "font-viewer" and the ability
        to edit font details.


    * Update (0.4.3)

        Added the following options

          Start application at login
          Start application minimized
          Include pangram in sample sheets
          Set default font size for sample sheets

        Removed unnecessary, possibly confusing, confirmation dialog
        when removing collections.

        Correct permissions for installed files.

        Some code cleanup

        Clean up obsolete files.


    * Update (0.4.2)

        Fix tray icon behavior, clicking it should always have an effect

        Fix homepage link in about dialog

        Don't allow exporting of empty collections, duh

        Include AFM files when exporting Type 1 fonts, oops, must
        not be a lot of use for this function or maybe Type 1 fonts,
        or someone would have mentioned it... oh, well it's useful to me. ;-)

        Ask for confirmation before exporting a collection
        Fix http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/issues/detail?id=6 by
        allowing user to specify where exported collection is to be saved,
        whether it should be compressed or not, and whether to include
        a sample sheet in the archive or folder.

        This last feature only works if ReportLab is installed and then
        only for Truetype and Type 1 fonts. Open Type supposedly works
        but I don't have any that do.


    * Update (0.4.1)

        Restart application instead of attempting to reload in place.


    * Update (0.4)

        Re-factored user interface to have a more flexible layout and take up
        less space while displaying the same amount of information.

        Added font installation/removal.

        Various bug fixes.


    * Update (0.3)

        Added the ability to compare fonts, thanks to gnome-specimen.

        When detailed info is requested it now brings up the selected style.

        Changed the way font information is loaded, this allows the application
        to have a map of exactly which files belong to which font family.

        It unfortunately also means that loading fonts is significantly slower,
        to compensate for this, results are now cached and re-used.

        Startup times on an X2 5600+ :

        First run  - 6300 fonts = 3m30.738s - Ouch!
        Second run - same fonts = 0m4.969s

        Also added a basic splash screen to provide some feedback in case
        someone actually has that many active fonts on their system.

        Various bug fixes.

        Code cleanup.


    * Update (0.2)

        Properly handle font names containing illegal characters.

        Return only the first result when detailed info is requested

        Added option to select different directories to scan

        Added option to export collections to an archive

        Added a category for fonts not present in user collections

        Added preferences dialog


    * Initial release (0.1)

        Preview release.
