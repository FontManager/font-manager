# Font Manager <img src="help/C/media/preferences-desktop-font.png" align="right">

A simple font management application for GTK Desktop Environments

![Main Window](https://github.com/FontManager/resources/blob/master/font-manager.png?raw=true)

Font Manager is intended to provide a way for average users to easily manage desktop fonts, without having to resort to command line tools or editing configuration files by hand. While designed primarily with the Gnome Desktop Environment in mind, it should work well with other GTK desktop environments.

Font Manager is NOT a professional-grade font management solution.

## Features

- Preview and compare font files
- Activate or deactivate installed font families
- Automatic categorization based on font properties
- Google Fonts Catalog integration
- Integrated character map
- User font collections
- User font installation and removal
- User font directory settings
- User font substitution settings
- Desktop font settings (GNOME Desktop or compatible environments)

## Localization

Font Manager is being translated using [Weblate](https://weblate.org), a web tool designed to ease translating for both developers and translators.

If you would like to help this application reach more users in their native language please visit the [project page on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/font-manager/).

## Installation


### Flatpak

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.FontManager'><img width='220' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-i-en.png'/></a>

- Access to xdg-config/fontconfig is necessary for other Flatpak applications to recognize changes made by Font Manager. You can use an application such as [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) or add --filesystem=xdg-config/fontconfig to the command used to launch the application. This needs to be done for every installed Flatpak application.

- Archive support does not work in Flatpak builds

#### File Manager extensions

Fedora and Ubuntu users can also find extensions for Nautilus, Nemo and Thunar in the repositories.

The extension currently allows you to quickly preview font files by simply selecting them in the file manager while font-viewer is open and also adds an option to install font files in the file manager context menu.

The Thunar extension also has very basic bulk renamer support.

### Building from source

You'll need to ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `meson >= 0.50`
- `ninja`
- `glib >= 2.62`
- `vala >= 0.42`
- `freetype2 >= 2.5`
- `gtk+-3.0 >= 3.22`
- `json-glib-1.0 >= 0.15`
- `libxml-2.0 >= 2.9`
- `sqlite3 >= 3.8`
- `gobject-introspection`
- `yelp-tools` (optional)
- `gettext` (optional)

If you wish to also build file manager extensions, you will need corresponding development libraries:

- `libnautilus-extension`
- `libnemo-extension`
- `thunar`

If you wish to also build Google Fonts integration, which is enabled by default, the following libraries are required:

- `webkit2gtk3 >= 2.24`
- `libsoup >= 2.62`

To build the application:

```
meson --prefix=/usr --buildtype=release build
cd build
ninja
```

To run the application without installing:

```
src/font-manager/font-manager
```

To install the application:

```
sudo ninja install
```

To uninstall:

```
sudo ninja uninstall
```

For a list of available build options:

```
meson configure
```

To change an option after the build directory has been configured:

```
meson configure -Dsome_option=true
```
